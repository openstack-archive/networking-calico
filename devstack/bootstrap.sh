#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT - Review before use!
#
# This script can be used to bootstrap a single or multi-node Calico/DevStack
# cluster.  Please note that it has not been exhaustively reviewed or tested
# for safety, and is designed for use on a fresh Ubuntu Trusty VM, with no data
# that you would care about losing.  We recommend that you review the following
# code, before running the script.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment Variables
#
# SERVICE_HOST
#
#     If the SERVICE_HOST environment variable is already set when ./stack.sh
#     is run, and is _different_ from the local machine's hostname, the
#     networking-calico DevStack plugin will interpret that as a request to set
#     up a compute-only node, that points to $SERVICE_HOST as its controller.
#
#     On the other hand, if SERVICE_HOST is not set, or is the _same_ as the
#     local hostname, the plugin will set up a combined controller and compute
#     node.
#
#     Therefore, to bring up a multi-node Calico/DevStack cluster, set and
#     export SERVICE_HOST in the environment, to the hostname for the chosen
#     controller node in your cluster, before invoking this script.
#
#     For a single node Calico/DevStack cluster, the environment should leave
#     SERVICE_HOST unset.
#
# TEST_GERRIT_CHANGE
#
#     By default this script uses the master branch of networking-calico.  To
#     test a networking-calico change in Gerrit that hasn't yet been merged to
#     master, set the TEST_GERRIT_CHANGE environment variable to indicate that
#     change, before running this script; for example:
#
#         export TEST_GERRIT_CHANGE=219646/1
#
# DEVSTACK_BRANCH
#
#     By default this script uses the master branch of devstack.  To use a
#     different branch, set the DEVSTACK_BRANCH environment variable before
#     running this script; for example:
#
#         export DEVSTACK_BRANCH=stable/liberty
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assume that we are starting from the home directory of a non-root
# user that can sudo, and hence is suitable for running DevStack.  For
# example, the 'ubuntu' user on Ubuntu.
